# Why Aurelia 2
Why you should choose Aurelia 2 for your next Web application in 2021 (and beyond).

## Introduction

More often than not, when developers and companies start a new Web application project, they will lean for React in most cases.

And React has proven itself to be a reasonable choice for front-end development (and other platforms). However, there is no denying that React of 2021 has a bit of a learning curve when you start throwing in additional packages like routers and state management solutions like Redux.

This overheard can slow down the developer experience substantially. 

If you have ever had to train someone in your architecture or help upskill members of your team who might not be front-end oriented, React itself is simple, but many of the packages the community have unofficially chosen as the "go to" packages for features are not. 

What if I told you there is an easier more modern solution that is actually a better option in many scenarios you might find yourself building for?

I have been working with Aurelia since 2015. Version 1 launched in 2015 and sadly, it just didn't take off. It wasn't the fact Aurelia was terrible, it was quite forward thinking, it just unfortunately came at a time when React was taking off and developers had bought into React promoting simplicity.
